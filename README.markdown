Loadrunner is a dependency manager
----------------------------------

Loadrunner started off as my science project script loader and module system but its turned into a generic dependency manager that you can build on to manage any type of asynchronous dependency from CSS templates to DOM events to cache loading.  It does however include build in support for loading regular JavaScript files, AMD modules and its own, more elegant flavor of modules.

Run the tests
-------------

Open test/test.html.  To run against the minified version open test/test.html?dist=true.
